**Humble Request !important**

All the enthusiastic contributors are requested to add their part carefully following the proper code block which is to be to be copy-pasted and then edited. Also, before sending a PR, it would be great if you yourself render the html page at least once to see how your changes are manifested. There have been instances where a single contribution destroyed the entire layout of the page, even affecting others' contributions.
